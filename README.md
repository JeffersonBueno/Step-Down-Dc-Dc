The article is being published in collaboration with JLCPCB. It is one of the most experienced PCB manufacturers with more than a decade in the 􀀞eld of PCB prototype and fabrication, they are committed to meeting the needs of our customers from different industries in terms of quality, delivery, cost-effectiveness and any other demanding requests.
# Introduction
The intention of this circuit is to encourage DIY because we know we can find identical models ready to buy. This circuit is
based on the LM2596S IC. We can energize the circuit with voltages from 4VDC to 40VDC and in its output we can obtain
from 1.5VDC to 35VDC with current up to 3 amps, controlling the output voltage by potentiometer.

# Requesting JLCPCB PCBs
For that, you just have to go to JLCPCB, and click on
“QUOTE NOW” button. JLCPCB are also sponsor of this project. JLCPCB (ShenzhenJLC Electronics Co., Ltd.), is the largest
PCB prototype enterprise in China and a high-tech manufacturer specializing in quick PCB prototype and small-batch
PCB production.
You can order a minimum of 5 PCBs for just $2. To get the PCB manufactured, upload the gerber 􀀞le you downloaded in
the last step. Upload the.zip 􀀞le or you can also drag and drop the gerber 􀀞les. After uploading the zip 􀀞le, you’ll see a
success message at the bottom if the 􀀞le is successfully uploaded. You can review the PCB in the Gerber viewer to make
sure everything is good. You can view both top and bottom of the PCB. After making sure our PCB looks good, we can
now place the order at a reasonable price. You can order 5 PCBs for just $2 but if it’s your 􀀞rst order then you can get 10
PCBs for $2. To place the order, click on “SAVE TO CART” button.
I have chosen to ship by Registered Air Mail to avoid customs fees but you can choose another shipping method.
After entering my shipping address I selected Pay Directly but you can ask for Review before Pay if you are unsure if
